# machine_learning
- Exercises from Machine learning course, Language Technology Mater's program, Uppsala university
- Purposes of understanding fundamental concepts in machine learning focusing on nlp tasks
- Starter codes, instructions from F. Wahlberg

## 1. Fiding decision boundary for classification task (exercise1.py)
- Implement a simple decision tree to manually find decision boudaries (the older artificial intelligence paradigm of finding clever rules)
- Build a class including following functions : init, predict, score

## 2. Optimazation for linear regression (exercise2.py)
- Build a class for 2D linear regression using an n-order polynomial as the model
- Implement following functions: parameter vector, predict, loss, improvement of parameter vectors, optimization loop, Higher order polynomial

## 3. Binary Logistic regression (exercise3.py)
- Develope the code, exercise2.py by adding an activation function (Sigmoid)
- Implement following functions: activation function to pass output through

## 4. Neural classification from scratch (exercise4.py)
- Implement following functions: parameter vectors (flattened, concatenated, reversed), Use cross entropy loss

## 5. Clustering with k-means (exercise5.py)
- Build a class implementing k-means clustering algorithm
- k-means clustering algorithm: identifies groups of data points iteratively, representing the clusters by their respective centres
